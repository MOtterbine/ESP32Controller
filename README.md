# ESP32Controller
Bluetooth code for ESP32 dev boards. 

This c++ code was developed using Visual Studio Code along with the PlatformIO extension. It is intended for use together with the MAUI Android at located at https://github.com/MOtterbine/ESP32_Android_Controller to demonstrate the ability of anyone to communicate across platforms and devices.
Both code sets are designed to be used as a starting point for experimenters of more complex and interesting things.
